# Custom Hash Function with Streamlit

## Description

This project implements a custom hash function and compares it with the popular cryptographic hash function, **SHA-256**. The app is built using **Streamlit** and allows users to input a string, view its hash generated by both the custom algorithm and SHA-256, and compare the results. The project demonstrates how slight changes in input result in significant differences in the hash output.

The **custom hash function** uses ASCII manipulation, modular arithmetic, and compression to produce a fixed-length hash.

## Features

- **Custom Hash Function**: Generates a unique hash based on the input string using an algorithm involving ASCII values, modular arithmetic, and compression.
- **SHA-256 Comparison**: Shows how the custom hash compares to the widely-used SHA-256 hash function.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy use and deployment. Allows users to input strings and see hash outputs in real-time.
- **Input Validation**: Prevents the user from submitting empty strings and provides helpful feedback.
- **GitHub Repository**: Contains the source code and the app for comparison.

## Live Demo

## Installation

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.7)
- pip (Python's package manager)

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Adhhiiiiiiii/custom-hash-streamlit.git
    cd custom-hash-streamlit
    ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the app**:
    Start the Streamlit app by running:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. **Visit the app**:
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to view the app.

## Usage

1. **Enter a string** in the provided text box.
2. **Click "Generate Hash"** to see the custom hash and the SHA-256 hash for the input string.
3. **Compare** the generated hashes to see how the custom hash function differs from SHA-256.
4. The app also provides an example string ("hello") when the app loads.

### Example Input and Output

For example:

- **Input**: `hello`
  
  - **Custom Hash**: `a3c7e2f5d93cfb4a560e...` (A 32-character hash generated by the custom algorithm)
  - **SHA-256 Hash**: `2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b169e6b846b7f7d167a16f7d5bce8e3` (Standard SHA-256 output)

### Important Notes

- Small changes in the input will result in large differences in the hash output, demonstrating the **avalanche effect** of cryptographic hash functions.
- This app is for educational purposes to demonstrate how hashing algorithms work.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit (`pip install streamlit`)
- hashlib (comes with Python standard library)
