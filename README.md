# 🔐 Custom Hash Function vs SHA-256 (Streamlit Project)

**Author:** Adhiyaman B 
**Date:** July 17

This project demonstrates a **custom hash algorithm** and compares it with **SHA-256** using a Streamlit web app.

## Features
- Custom hash algorithm using ASCII manipulation, shifts, and modular arithmetic.
- Comparison with standard SHA-256 hash.
- Demonstration of hash sensitivity to small input changes.
- Hosted online using Streamlit Cloud.

## Run Locally
```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
